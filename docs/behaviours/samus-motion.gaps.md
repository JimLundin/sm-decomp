# Samus moving through the world: integration gaps

Where wiring [the spec](samus-motion.md)'s model into the engine finds something that doesn't fit
(MODEL §5). Each gap names the frame, the field, the expected and actual values and the suspected
entry. The integrator files them; the observer answers them in the spec.

No gap is open. The previous spec's gaps and answers are in git history (`1dc3a12`).

## Open: what wiring the model into the engine needs (integrator, 2026-11-07)

These come from wiring, not from a differing frame: the engine can't drive the model's public API
as it stands without a stand-in. None has a frame yet; each names the entry it touches.

1. **The pose a frame changes to depends on that frame's moves (§7, `Landing`,
   `WallsAndCeilings`, `FollowingTheGround`).** `Frame::next_pose` is an input given before the
   step, but in the game the pose a frame takes is chosen after its moves: a landing, a fall from
   the ground's edge, a ceiling, a wall stop and a wall jump's kick each choose it. The harness
   can read it from the next record (a stand-in that answers from the oracle, MODEL §4); the
   engine can't. Asked of the model: one step that, after the moves and before the pose change,
   asks the caller for the pose with what the moves met (landed, left the ground, hit a ceiling,
   stopped at a wall, kicked off a wall), for example through a trait the caller implements.
   The alternative, two passes (the moves on a copy to learn what they met, then the real step),
   duplicates the frame's work and infers the contacts from the State's change.
2. **Blocks that react when she reaches them (§8, §10).** In the recorded rows her moves reach
   scroll triggers (area-brinstar, the elevator ride's step) and an item's block (item-morph-ball,
   the pickup), which let her through and start something. `World::block` answers only air,
   solid, stepped or sloped, and nothing tells the caller which cells a move reached. The adapter
   can record every cell asked, but the model may ask cells the game's moves don't, or in another
   order. Asked: the set and order of cells a move reaches, as the spec defines it, so the world
   can report which reactive cells she reached.
3. **The other block kinds (§10).** Doors, spikes, crumble and speed blocks, shootable, grapple
   and bombable blocks, and the blocks that stand for another block (a run of one block's cells).
   The adapter answers solid for the solid-to-touch kinds and resolves a standing-for cell to the
   cell it names, as the engine's collision does today; the spec should say so or list them.
4. **A walk along a sloped floor changes the move's length (§10).** Today's engine scales a
   horizontal move on a non-square sloped floor, with no vertical speed, by the shape's factor;
   the model doesn't. Every recorded frame that walks a slope will differ in x until that entry
   exists.
5. **Pose fit moves her between the pose choice and the pose's speed changes.** When her body
   grows, the game pushes her clear of the blocks (out of scope, the header) after choosing the
   pose and before the crouch lift and the pose change's writes. The model does the crouch lift
   and the writes inside the step, so the push lands after them in the engine. Whether any
   recorded frame tells the two orders apart is not yet measured.
