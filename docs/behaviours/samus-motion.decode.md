# Samus moving through the world: decode notes

For the observer, the adversary and the domain harness's decoder only. Implementers never see this
file (MODEL §5). It holds every source the spec draws on: the original's routines, its RAM and its
codes. Addresses are the bank logs' (`$TEMP/c4a/logs*`, https://patrickjohnston.org/bank/).

## How the spec was made

Behaviour first: the 32 rows in `tools/oracle/samus_motion_rows.txt`, cached in
`$TEMP/collab/more-caches/cache`, were dumped per frame (`$TEMP/obs-ground/dump`, driven by
`$TEMP/respec-motion/one.ps1`, output in `$TEMP/respec-motion/out`) and read over time. The
previous spec's arithmetic, which was pinned from the bank logs, was reused only for exact values
and edge cases. Vectors come from `$TEMP/respec-motion/scripts/vec.pl` (frame selection), `tag.pl`
(entries) and `lead.pl` (perceivable quantities and lead-ins); the constructed ones were worked by
hand from the rules, and `cons.pl` rewrote them to perceivable quantities.

**Row names.** The vectors and the spec name the chain rows by opaque ids, because a chain row's
name carries a room header's address:

| Id | Row |
| --- | --- |
| r01 | chain-0012-91F8 (Landing Site) |
| r02 | chain-0013-92FD |
| r03 | chain-0014-96BA |
| r04 | chain-0057-9FBA |
| r05 | chain-0059-A293 |
| r06 | chain-0097-ACF0 |
| r07 | chain-0100-B07A |
| r08 | chain-0106-AD5E |

**Frame selection for recorded vectors.** Record N is the State before, record N+1 after; the pad
is record N's. Taken when: the frame counter `05B6` advances by one (no lag); `0A66` is 0; the
movement type `0A1F` is one of the domain's; the pose `0A1C` and the radii `0AFE`/`0B00` are the
same at N and N+1 (or, for a landing, `0B36` goes from non-zero to 0 with y's subpixel FFFF); the
slope flag `0DBA` is 0 at both; extra run `0B42` is below 2.0 (no speed booster); the x move equals
± the frame's total speed `0DBC`.`0DBE`; in the air, `0DC6` is 0 at N+1 and the y move equals the
frame-start vertical velocity, or 0 at the apex; on the ground, y unchanged with y.sub FFFF and the
floor (y + y radius) on a 16 px line. Excluded rows: chain-0220-D017, chain-0224-D0B9,
chain-0232-D5A7, area-maridia (water), terrain-quicksand, samus-ceres-push (pushes). area-brinstar
and samus-square-slope-reserve give few or none (elevator, slopes). At most one vector per kind
(activity, vertical, drive, pad direction, run) per row, nine per row. The pad's bindings are taken
as the defaults (jump A `0080`, run B `8000`, shoot X `0040`); a row with other bindings would be
misread (not checked: `09B2`-`09B6` are not in the dump).

**Lead-ins (`lead.pl`).** A vector's start must be *plain* (spec §1.2's last paragraph): `0B3C` ≠ 0
or `0B42` = 0; `0B4A` = 0, or 1 with `0B46` > 0; `0B36` = 1 only with a non-zero magnitude;
`0B36` = 2 with magnitude 0 only in an airborne movement type (2 outside the take-off poses, 3, 6,
8, 12h, 13h, 14h); `0B36` = 0 only with magnitude 0 outside those types. From the checked frame
`lead.pl` walks back while each frame passes the selection test above, with radii free to change
(a pose may change only from movement type 0, 1 or 10h on the ground into a jump, spin, fall or
turn, from a take-off pose into a jump, or by aim alone, which the x-move test keeps clear of the
arm-pump step), to the nearest plain start, at most 120 frames. A world of open air takes the floor
of a ground frame met on the way if every later airborne frame stays above it. A start with a bounce
in play drops the vector. Of 149 recorded frames, 118 were kept (gaps-v3 dropped six, below), 23 of them with a lead-in of 1 to
12 frames; 31 are dropped (no plain start reachable). The two constructed moonfall vectors were
dropped: they set the moonfall as a start value, and no lead-in through a turn's end is worked yet.

## State

| Quantity | RAM | Decode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| position | x `0AF6`.`0AF8`, y `0AFA`.`0AFC` | as is |
| horizontal speed | `0B46`.`0B48`, facing `0A1E`, `0B4A` | magnitude `0B46`.`0B48`; leftward when facing left (`0A1E` low byte 4) with `0B4A` ≠ 1, or facing right or the screen with `0B4A` = 1 |
| dash | `0B42`.`0B44` | as is |
| vertical speed | `0B2E`.`0B2C` (a magnitude), `0B36` | `0B36` = 2: + magnitude; else − magnitude (two's complement over 32 bits) |
| bounces | `0B20` low byte | 0, 1, 2 |
| pose | `0A1C`, `0A1E` | body and action from the movement type `0A1F` (below); facing `0A1E` low byte 4 Left, 8 Right, 0 Screen |

What she remembers (spec §1.2), for the decoder and the adversary only: carrying on and skidding
are `0B4A` (0 follows the pad, 2 carries on, 1 skids; a skid of zero is `0B4A` = 1 with `0B46` =
0); a dash to lose is `0B3C` = 0 with `0B42` ≠ 0; the moonfall is `0B36` = 0 in the air; a spin
carried on is `0A27` ∈ {3, 14h}. None is in the spec's State. The horizontal speed's sign is exact
except for the skid of zero, which the spec states as a behaviour.

Pose decode by movement type: 0 Upright Still (poses 00, 9B face the screen); 1 Running; 2
Jumping (TakingOff for 4B, 4C, 55-5A); 3 Spinning; 4 Ball, Still for 1D, 41, else Rolling; 5
Crouched Still; 6 Falling; 8 Ball Falling; E, 17, 18 Turning; F by pose: 35, 36, F3 Crouching, 37,
38 Morphing, 3B, 3C StandingUp, 3D, 3E Unmorphing; 10 Moonwalking; 11 SpringBall (Still for 79,
7A, else Rolling); 12 SpringBall Jumping; 13 SpringBall Falling; 14 WallJumping; 15 AgainstWall.
Other types are outside the domain (0A knockback, 16 grapple, 19 damage boost, 1B shinespark).

**RAM shape** (fields decoded as one word copied as-is): none. Positions, speeds and the dash join
two words; the two speeds are signed from a magnitude and a direction; bounces are mapped.

**Inputs.** pad held `8B`, newly pressed `8F`; equipment `09A2` (0100 hi-jump, 0200 space jump);
spin turned far: animation frame `0A96` ≥ 0B (≥ 1B in poses 81, 82); elevator moving: `0E18` ≠ 0.

## Sources per entry

Each entry lists only the routines or branches that carry its content, not the helpers it shares
with others (adversary-2 §1's count): 2 of 18 entries (11 %) are single-routine, marked *,
and `scan.sh --mirror` agrees.

| Entry | Source |
| --- | --- |
| SpeedBuildsAndBrakes | `$90:9BD1` and its table (the speeds by situation), `$90:9A7E` (speed-up), `$90:9B1F` (braking), the standing, crouching, transition, ran-into-wall and facing-forward handlers' tail stops in `$90:A337`'s table, `$90:A521` (the ball) |
| Dash | `$90:973E`, `$90:97D5` (the cap), `$91:DE53` (losing it), `$90:E5CE` (the wall stop's share) |
| TurningRound | `$91:F543` (turn start and spin reverse), `$90:A68F` (turning handler, its sink and its end), `$90:A67C` (the creep), `$91:81A9` with `$91:82D9`, `$91:8304` and `$91:ECD0` (letting go: the failed transition lookup's stop command clears `0B4A` after the move) |
| AimingAndShooting | `$91:EADE` (the step), `$90:A3AD` (the shot) |
| RidingTheElevator* | `$90:A392`, `$90:A397` (two branches of the facing-forward handler) |
| Jumping | `$90:98BC` (the speed table), `$91:FBBB` (take-off), `$91:F624` and `$91:F8D3` (jump starts), `$90:A488` (space jump) |
| FollowingTheGround | `$90:923F` (the pull), `$90:E61B` (walking off) |
| MovesAsShePosed | `$90:A337` (the handler of the frame-start pose), `$91:EB88` (the pose taken after) |
| RisingAndFalling | `$90:90E2` and `$90:913A` (gravity), `$90:910C` (the limit), `$90:8FDC`, `$90:9046` and `$90:90C4` (the rise's end: `0B2E` read as signed, ends when negative), `$91:F22B` (bounce 2 at 0.0) |
| DriftInTheAir | `$90:900D`, `$90:9174`, `$90:91A8` (normal jump and fall), `$90:906C` and `$90:9093` (spin; its stop still calls `$90:8EA9`, which adds the extra run speed) |
| Moonfall | `$91:EBAF`, `$91:F36E` (the hand-over), `$90:913A` (no limit with direction 0) |
| WallJump | `$90:9D35` (arming and kick test), `$90:90B3` (one distance, `$90:9E9F` = 8, for both), `$91:FA0F` (kick), `$94:967F` (the probe) |
| Landing | `$91:F010`, `$90:A640` (upright and changing), `$91:F1FC`, `$91:F25E` (the ball) |
| BlocksStopFlush | `$94:8F49`, `$94:8F82` (horizontal and vertical block collision), `$90:E4AD` (the limit) |
| WallsAndCeilings | `$90:E5CE` (wall), `$90:E606` and `$91:EFDF` (ceiling) |
| SolidEnemies | `$A0:AAC8`, `$90:9D80`, `$90:9DF8`, `$90:93B1`, `$90:93EC` and `$90:9440` (enemy test first; on a hit the move skips block collision, as the bank log's zebetite-skip note says) |
| SlopesCarry | `$90:9376`, `$94:87F4` (seat after every horizontal move, sets `0DBA`), `$90:924C` (the pull reads `0DBA`), `$94:976F` (cleared by a non-zero vertical move), `$94:8E38` (square slope stop sets it), `$94:86FE` (rising into a non-square ceiling slope: `$12 = max(0, ...)` and `$14 = 0`, so no move) |
| WordwiseTopSpeed* | `$90:9A99` |

**The pose chart's effects** (spec §7) are the prospective pose-change commands `0A2E` 1, 2, 6 and
8 (`$91:EC50`..`$91:ECD7`). The spec no longer names them; the pose-chart lane gives each
transition its outcome as data. Command 6 has no RTS and falls through into command 8, so a change
that kills the run speed also zeroes and cancels the dash: spec §7's one fact.

## Gaps v3 (the first implementation's nine)

| Vectors | Answer | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R29, R37 | dropped | she rises into a non-square ceiling slope (block type 1, BTS 93h above her at samus-walljump-28:61); `0DBA` stays 0 there, so the selection missed it |
| R30, R38 | restarted after the hit | the same frames, now from a plain falling start |
| R50, R51 | dropped | `0A58` = `$90:E025`/`$90:E032`: bomb jump |
| R67, R68 | dropped | `0A58` = `$90:946E`: released from grapple swing |
| R125 | spec | `DriftInTheAir`: the spin's stop moves by the dash |
| R133 | spec | `TurningRound`: lookup failure (pad 0000), command 2 |

Frame selection now also needs `0A58` = `$90:A337` at record N. New: J1 r03:470, J2 r04:474, J3
r04:475, A1 area-norfair:3 (poses 0Ah to 12h, +1 px), E1 samus-ceres-push:989 (`0A58` normal; the
row's push is elsewhere); constructed E2 (y from samus-ceres-push:990), E3, C-ceiling. The dumper
used is `$TEMP/gaps-v3/dump` (the ground dumper without its under-block probe, which overflows on
rows whose position wraps, plus the blocks above, below and beside her).

## Harness notes kept from the previous spec

The domain harness (`verify::harness::samus_motion`) decodes the previous spec's types; its frame
skips (game state `0998`, lag, the elevator `0E18`, pose fit, handlers `0A44` and `0A58`, the
deferred behaviours) and the bridge's answers are in git history at `1dc3a12`
(`docs/behaviours/samus-motion.decode.md`). They carry over once the implementer's new types exist.

## Gaps v4 (the second implementation's one, and its four readings)

| Question | Answer | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R141 (r08:116, run held, turning in the air) | spec | `$91:81A9` calls the lookup failure (`$91:82D9`, command 2, which ends the skid) only when `8B` = 0; with any button held and no transition found it returns without a command, so `0B4A` stays 1 (r08:117 shows 1, r08:118 0 once braking passes zero). Movement types Eh and 17h both map to 2 in `$91:8332`: air and ground agree |
| A downward stop on a sloped floor | spec, C-slope-land | `$94:86FE` down branch sets `$14` = 0 and clamps `$12`; `$94:9763` adds it, so `0AFC` is kept (r01:677 `57FF`, samus-walljump-22:93 `FBFF`, samus-input-poses:426 `93FF`); only the block whose column holds `0AF6` counts; no `0DBA`. The square kinds (`$94:8DBD`) write `FFFF` and set `0DBA` |
| The seat after a horizontal move | spec | `$94:87F4`: floor sets `0DBA` only when A < 0 (lifted ≥ 1 px); ceiling when A ≤ 0 (a 0 px push seats). Both skip square kinds (BTS & 1Fh < 5) and the other orientation (BTS bit 7) |
| Slopes and horizontal moves | spec | `$94:84D6` (non-square) always returns carry clear; `$94:8D2B` (square) stops flush at the 8 px quarter with `0AF8` FFFF/0 |
| The wall-jump test on an enemy | spec | `$90:9D80`/`$90:9D92` call `$A0:A8F0`, whose touching branch `$A0:AAC8` clears `0AFC`; the block probe `$94:967F` is skipped on a hit |
